   Mini-assignment 0 (OPTIONAL)
  </h1>
  <p><b>This is an optional assignment. The auto-grader will be run on it, but no marks will be assigned.</b></p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    File name:
   </strong>
   my_number.py
  </p>
  <p>
   Write a python script that does the following 3 things. Save it in a file called my_number.py and hand in the file.
  </p>
  <ol>
   <li>
    Store your favourite number in a variable called
    <code>
     my_number
    </code>
    .
   </li>
   <li>
    Print
    <code>
     My favourite number is
    </code>
    followed by the value of
    <code>
     my_number
    </code>
    , for example,
    <code>
     My favourite number is 13
    </code>
   </li>
   <li>
    Write a function called
    <code>
     hooray
    </code>
    that takes as argument an integer and prints
    <code>
     hooray!
    </code>
    that number of times, separated by new lines. For example, the output of
    <code>
     hooray(3)
    </code>
    should be:
   </li>
  </ol>
  <pre><code class="python">hooray!
hooray!
hooray!
</code></pre>
  <p>
   To help you get started, here is come code you can modify. Replace
   <code>
    None
   </code>
   with your favourite number. Replace
   <code>
    pass
   </code>
   with what you want
   <code>
    hooray
   </code>
   to do.
  </p>
  <pre><code class="python">my_number = None  # replace None with a number

# use print() to print my favourite number is, followed by my_number

def hooray(n):
    """
    print "hooray!" n times
    """
    pass  # replace pass with your instructions
</code></pre>
  <p>
   You can use a Jupyter Notebook to help you test your code. You should make sure it works by running it and feeding
   <code>
    hooray
   </code>
   some numbers. However, in the end,
   <strong>
    Do not hand in the Notebook
   </strong>
   . Instead, open up a new, empty, Python file in Spyder, copy your code into it, and
   <strong>
    save it as my_number.py
   </strong>
   .
