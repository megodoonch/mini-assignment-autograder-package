**File name:** my_number.py

Write a python script that does the following 3 things. Save it in a file called my_number.py and hand in the file.

1. Store your favourite number in a variable called `my_number`. 
2. Print `My favourite number is ` followed by the value of `my_number`, for example,  `My favourite number is 13`
3. Write a function called `hooray` that takes as argument an integer and prints `hooray!` that number of times, separated by new lines. For example, the output of `hooray(3)` should be:

```python
hooray!
hooray!
hooray!
```

To help you get started, here is come code you can modify. Replace `None` with your favourite number. Replace `pass` with what you want `hooray` to do. 


```python
my_number = None  # replace None with a number

# use print() to print my favourite number is, followed by my_number

def hooray(n):
    """
    print "hooray!" n times
    """
    pass  # replace pass with your instructions
```

You can use a Jupyter Notebook to help you test your code. You should make sure it works by running it and feeding `hooray` some numbers. However, in the end, **Do not hand in the Notebook**. Instead, open up a new, empty, Python file in Spyder, copy your code into it, and **save it as my_number.py**.
