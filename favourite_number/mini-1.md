**File name:** my_number.py

Write a python script that does the following 2 things. Save it in a file called my_number.py and hand in the file.

1. Store your favourite number in a variable called `my_number`. 
2. Print `My favourite number is ` followed by the value of `my_number`, for example,  `My favourite number is 13`

To help you get started, here is come code you can modify. Replace `None` with your favourite number. Replace `pass` with what you want `hooray` to do. 


```python
my_number = None  # replace None with a number

# use print() to print my favourite number is, followed by my_number
```

You can use a Jupyter Notebook to help you test your code. However, in the end, **Do not hand in the Notebook**. Instead, follow the instructions, posted separately, for how to make a python file. **Save it as my_number.py**.
